# T Thompson: Mobile IOS/Android Reminder App

This project was created inside of React Native using expo, html, css and javascript. The purpose of the project is to showcase my competency within a mobile development context. The app runs on both IOS and Android. 

The app taps into several native device features such as the date/time module and async storage to save the reminders locally, state is managed using useContext/useReducer.
